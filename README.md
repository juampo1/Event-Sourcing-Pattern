# Event-Sourcing-Pattern
Understanding Event Sourcing pattern while learning GO

There are two demos: 
  1- eventonly: where I learn and practice how events works and why they are useful.
  2- eventsandhandlers: Where I learn and implement CQRS using events. In this demo I added commands that mutate the aggregates.
